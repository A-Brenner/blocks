Project Description:
User is spawned in the center of the LED array of sense hat with a unique color. 4 Opposing blocks are spawned on each side of the LED array in a random position against the edge. They each begin to rapidly move to the other side. The user must attempt to avoid these opposing blocks by using the joystick. The user can move up, down, left, or right by use of the joystick. Using the magnet's data, the user may hit enter at any moment during the game to change the opposing block's color. Taking information from the x,y,z data points of the Magnet in the sense hat, it determines the color given to the opposing blocks. When the user has collided with an opposing block, the screen will freeze in place, the user's position with glow with a red hue to indicate their death. The user must press enter on the joystick to clear the screen and end the program.
